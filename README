input1.in, input2.in, input3.in and input4.in are a few examples
of inputs for testing the program

	The program reads the entire input which contains a command
and the codification of the Turing Machine.
	The codification's format is:
number_of_states
final_state_1 ... final_state_p
transition_1
transition_2
...
transition_n

	On the first line the input will have what action the program
will do.
	If it's "accept", it will receive words and the codification of
the TM and will print true or false for every word if it is accepted
or not.
	If it's "step", it will receive a list of configurations which will
represent one at a time the input for the TM. The program will print
the list of returned configurations.
	If it's "k_accept", it will receive words and for every word a
number of steps and will check if the word is accepted by the TM 
in that respective number of steps.
